# 🔄 Update Instructions - RTL Fix & Saved Icon Fix

## Changes Made

### ✅ 1. Fixed "Saved" Icon Stuck Issue
**What was wrong:** The "נשמר" (saved) icon would stay visible permanently
**What was fixed:** The timeout that resets the icon to hidden is now properly tracked and cleared
**Result:** The saved icon will appear after save, then disappear after 3 seconds

### ✅ 2. Enabled RTL (Right-to-Left) Layout
**What was wrong:** Hebrew text and UI elements were showing left-to-right
**What was fixed:** Added RTL configuration to the app root
**Result:** All text and UI elements will flow right-to-left (Hebrew style)

## 📱 How to Get These Updates on Your Phone

You have **2 options**:

### **Option 1: OTA Update (Faster - 2 minutes)**

For the **Saved Icon Fix** ONLY:
```bash
npx eas update --branch preview
```

**What this does:**
- Updates the JavaScript code
- Works for the saved icon fix
- Takes 1-2 minutes
- **Does NOT** include RTL fix (needs full rebuild)

**After running:**
1. Close the app completely on your phone
2. Reopen it
3. The saved icon should now work correctly

### **Option 2: Full Rebuild (15-20 minutes)**

For **BOTH** fixes (Saved Icon + RTL):
```bash
npx eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

**What this does:**
- Creates a completely new APK with all changes
- Includes RTL configuration
- Takes 15-20 minutes

**After the build completes:**
1. Download the new APK from the link provided
2. Install it on your phone (might ask to uninstall old version first)
3. Both fixes will be active

## 🎯 Recommended Approach

**For now:**

npx eas update --branch preview

```
This will add RTL layout support.
